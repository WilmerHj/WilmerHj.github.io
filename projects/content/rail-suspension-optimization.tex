**Problem statement.** Train model comfort optimization at constant speed, using measured track profile.

**Model.** Two-DOF spring-mass-damper model solved with RK4 and tuned in MATLAB.

Optimization was performed on suspension stiffness and damping to reduce RMS acceleration while maintaining feasible dynamic response, including robustness against impulses in the track profile.
