**Overview.** Prediction model for golf trajectory and optimization of a parametric club head.

**Trajectory model.** Drag and lift are modeled as
$$
F_D = k_{Drag} v^2, \quad F_L = k_{Lift} v^2.
$$

A non-linear least-squares fit (MATLAB `fminsearch`) was used to estimate aerodynamic coefficients from simulator data.

**Geometry optimization.** Latin Hypercube Sampling + `fmincon` were used to maximize carry under design bounds.
