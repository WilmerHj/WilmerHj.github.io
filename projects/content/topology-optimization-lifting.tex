**Overview.** A generalized lifting attachment was developed to reduce tool-change bottlenecks.

**Method.** Topology optimization + FEM in Ansys Mechanical was used to trade off stress vs. mass.

A curved-beam hand-check was used for validation:
$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} + M \cdot \frac{r_n - r_i}{A \cdot e \cdot r_i}.
$$
