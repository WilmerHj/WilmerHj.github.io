**Overview.** An accurate controlled robot that can move on ground and in air.

**Odometry.** Designed & built a balancing drone robot including both mechanical parts and control algorithms for automated navigation in MATLAB/Simulink.

For wheel $i$, the velocity is
$$
V_i = \bar{V} + \overline{r_{i/C}} \times \bar{\omega}.
$$

With wheel offsets $\pm \frac{L}{2}$ from the center:
$$
\begin{cases}
V_l = V - \frac{L}{2}\,\omega_z, \\
V_r = V + \frac{L}{2}\,\omega_z.
\end{cases}
$$
